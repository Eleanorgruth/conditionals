# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel pretty confident, I referenced them while doing this assignment but feel like I am becoming more and more comfortable.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
So far so good! Right now I only know the 2 referenced in the lesson but it makes sense: && the first value AND the second value are true, and || is if one or both is true.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I feel fairly confident, I liked to reference the lesson while writing them so I wouldn't have any syntax error.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent so much time on this lesson... I somehow missed the the first README file and just read the one in the codeChallenges, so I did all the code challenges and then realized that there was more practice to be done. Managing my time effectively is going to be a struggle for me, but it would've helped to read the correct directions.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still need to complete the for statements lesson and the DTR prep tonight and it is 8:42 pm mst so I'm just going to push through! I think that tomorrow will be smooth sailing without a live session and I'll be able to review and prepare for the evaluation.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I am wondering how much of the syntax needs to be memorized? Like I said before, I referenced the lesson a lot while doing this assignment. Is that something that I should avoid and start to commit this all to memory?
